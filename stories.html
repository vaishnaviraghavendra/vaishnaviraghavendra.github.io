                    <p>Writing about my first solo trip was long overdue, and I’m finally doing it almost a month later. Going on a solo trip before I turned 25 had always been one of those cliché bucket list dreams, and I finally made it happen.</p>
                    <p>Being the only child of protective parents, I never really had the freedom to go around much, not even for school trips. Sometimes I still wonder how this trip even happened. It took a lot of convincing to get my mom’s approval.</p>
                    <p>I started planning in late August, made my bookings in September, and finally flew in October. The two nights before my flight, I could barely sleep. Since it was also my first international trip, I was extremely nervous. My mind was racing — who will watch my luggage when I go to the restroom? what if I lose my phone or passport? I even made a list of steps to follow in case my passport got lost.</p>
                    <p>On October 6th, around 5:30 PM, I stepped into Terminal 2 of Bangalore Airport. After I got lounge access for the first time, I walked in feeling like the most excited kid among a crowd of serious business travellers. I even met a company director heading to Turkey who shared some Singapore travel tips.</p>
                    <p>When I got in the flight, I got lucky — I had three seats all to myself! I slept across them for most of the flight. At 4:30 AM, when my phone connected to the Singtel network, it was pure joy. That was the moment it truly hit me that this trip is actually happening.</p>
                                                            <h5 class="mt-3">Day 1</h5>
                                                            <p>Landed at Changi Airport, collected my luggage, and felt both exhausted and starving. I tried finding a lounge and ended up walking all the way to Lounge, only to learn it opens at 7 AM. Almost all shops were closed except Burger King, but everything on their menu had chicken or beef, so I just grabbed a coffee.</p>
                                                            <p>I took the MRT to my hotel, dropped off my luggage, and headed straight to Sentosa Island for Harry Potter Visions of Magic. Being a fan, this was absolutely magical, even though I was on the fourth day of my period, running on just a croissant. After lunch, all I wanted then was to crash at the hotel. But I pushed myself to explore Chinatown, where everything was in Chinese and the food stalls were crowded with the smell of meat everywhere, so I gave up on eating. Came back to the hotel, freshened up and went to Bugis Street for shopping and finally after 22,000 steps, I slept.</p>

                    <h5 class="mt-3">Day 2</h5>
                    <p>I had booked an 8 AM tour for the Sky Garden two weeks earlier and instantly regretted that timing. Dragged myself out of bed, put the location on Maps, and found myself in the middle of the city surrounded by sharply dressed professionals rushing to work.</p>
                    <p>At the building, I took the elevator to the 51st floor, the highest I’ve ever been and discovered it was the world’s highest food forest! From there, I had breathtaking views of Marina Bay Sands, Gardens by the Bay, and more.</p>
                    <p>Later, I headed toward Marina Bay Sands, but the map kept saying 1 km more no matter how far I walked. Eventually, I asked a guy with a backpack for directions — he turned out to be a Japanese businessman just as lost as I was. We walked together, and it was nice having company. We also clicked a picture (little memory from my solo trip).</p>
                    <p>By the time I reached the viewpoint, I was exhausted and desperately needed coffee. I still couldn’t believe people were running shirtless in that heat while I could barely walk.</p>
                    <p>My friend had recommended xiao long bao, so I went to Din Tai Fung. There was a 30-minute wait, so I explored the mall, and when I finally got my table, a robot guided me to it (definitely a wow moment). That meal became the highlight of my day.</p>
                    <p>I then visited Gardens by the Bay, rented a bicycle (something I’d been wanting to do), and later treated myself to a vegetarian meal that cost $22 — the most expensive of the trip! The lady at the counter, who looked Indian, chatted with me and said I looked too young to be traveling alone. (proud moment)</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Day 3</h5>
                    <p>I had planned a relaxing day since I’d already covered most sightseeing spots. But shopping took up half the day! The highlight was the Don Don Donki Japanese store — I couldn’t stop humming along to their catchy theme song.</p>
                    <p>By evening, I started packing, which took forever. Since I hadn’t really experienced Singapore’s nightlife yet, I went out immediately after sunset and instantly fell in love with the city’s night vibe!</p>
                    <p>While I was out, an Indian girl asked me to take her picture. We got talking and ended up going for dinner together, such a fun, unexpected end to the day. I returned to my hotel around 11:30 PM really sad because I had to leave the next day.</p>
                    <h5 class="mt-3">Day 4</h5>
                    <p>My uncle, who lives near the Malaysia border, invited me over. He surprised me with a Châteraisé pastry — the exact one I was waiting to try but couldn’t earlier because they accepted only cash.</p>
                    <p>They later dropped me at the airport, where I finally saw the Jewel at Changi — absolutely stunning. I learned that locals actually visit the airport just to hang out when they’re bored of the city, and honestly, I get why.</p>
                    <p>As my flight took off, I didn’t want to leave. The girl who boarded the plane nervous and overthinking everything was now returning home confident.</p>
                    <p>This trip gave me more than memories — it gave me self-confidence. I couldn’t be prouder of myself. And I hope my dad is proud of his girl too.</p>
